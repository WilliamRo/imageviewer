# imageviewer
> Matlab R2014b or later version is required.

Change directory to the root of your matlab project and run the codes below to add these package as a submodule:
<br>
`git submodule add https://github.com/WilliamRo/imageviewer +imv`
<br>
For some reason, the package name `+imv` should not be changed.
